# Wha I learned
- two way data binding
   - When use two way data binding, the target data is sychoronized between template and ts, or the UI and the underlying data model
   - In this project I also learned to use property inline in the template, to determine/assign the data values inline
      - e.g username can be assigned using "=" sign and determine T or F using "==="
